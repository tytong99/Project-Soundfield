# Project soundfield: Acoustic-Array-Simulator-Project
Wishing to establish a set of housekeeping cartesian coordinate definition & signal processing tools to achive simple & linear simulation of any acoustic array performance & algorithms, based on analytical signals & green function.
Capabilities (hopefully one day) include: sound source & sound field & trans-ceiver coordinate definition, radiation & transmission definition, and final soundfield / received signal computation, for different types of arrays in acoustics (because I am no where near getting familiar with EM wave & antennas).
